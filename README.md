## How to Update this Repository ##
1. Create an empty folder in your local machine
2. Use `git clone <repository url>` to clone the repository in this location. This will be your workspace. 
3. In order to save your work and push to the github repository so we can both see it you will need the following commands (generally executed in this order)
+ `git add <filename.extension>`
+ `git commit -m " your message here "`
+ `git push origin master`
4. If you would like to remove a file, you can try that on your own, or worst case just ask me and I will do it :)
5. To check if you have added a file you may issue the command `git status` in order to show which files are staged for commit.

## Git Commands Explained: ##
+ `git add <filename.extension>`
> will add the file you would like to push to the github repository and share with me. Be careful you do not add anything that has sensitive information.
+ `git commit -m " . . . "`
> Once you have added the files you are going to push to the repository you must `git commit -m " . . . "` them. This step is essentially saving your work.
+ `git push origin master`
> After you have committed the files, the final step is to issue `git push origin master`. The syntax for this command is actually `git push <from> <to>`. In this case we are pushing from the `origin` to the `master` branch.
because this isnt a large scale project, I doubt we will have multiple branches.

## misc. ##
+ Other useful commands are `git pull`, but I am not sure when you would need to use it.
